With all new desgin and shape, a challenge is guaranteed to be presented before you.

But there's more. Besides hold more than twice the amount of shape presented than in Tetris, the big brother also
gives you the opportunity to call onto Miss Luck and switch the playing shape once everytime a new round starts.
